Build Community.</strong></p><p>Flock Safety provides a public safety operating system that empowers private communities and law enforcement to work together to eliminate crime. We are committed to protecting human privacy and mitigating bias in policing with the development of best-in-class technology rooted in ethical design, which unites civilians and public servants in pursuit of a safer, more equitable society.</p><p><br></p><p>Our Safety-as-a-Service approach includes affordable devices powered by LTE and solar that can be installed anywhere.

We believe the right person for this role is much more than a great engineer. But to get into the nitty gritty, currently our stack looks like:</p><ul><li>Typescript (Node) web services with a bit of Scala and Go in there as well as needed</li><li>React on the frontend, but also some mix of plain ole HTML, CSS (bootstrap), and Javascript (jQuery + KnockoutJS) as needed</li><li>Postgres DB, but occasionally Redis or DynamoDB (use the right tool for the job)</li><li>Kubernetes, Docker</li><li>AWS (SQS, S3, etc)</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why join the Flock?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When you join the Flock, you are joining a diverse team of passionate, ambitious, intelligent people that put team over self. We offer competitive salary, benefits, and the opportunity to grow your career at a fast-paced, high growth start up.

We tackle research problems in the areas of databases, big data, cloud, systems-for-ML, and ML-for-systems. Our mission is to advance the Microsoft Azure Data organization, and we do so in three ways: (i) innovating within Microsoft products and services (ii) publishing in top-tier conferences and journals, and (iii) actively contributing to open-source projects. The team spans multiple geographical locations (Redmond WA, Sunnyvale CA, Madison WI, Atlanta GA) with a mix of researchers, engineers, and data scientists. With team members originating from 10 countries and 4 continents, each of us brings something authentically unique to the team. In this diverse and inclusive environment, creativity, open dialogue, and a healthy work-life balance are powering GSL innovation and helping each of us grow.<br><br><strong>Your Role<br><br></strong>As a <strong>Research Engineer</strong>, you will have the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology to build next-generation cloud data platforms. You will collaborate closely with researchers and product engineers to push the boundaries of our technology stack. This involves quickly picking up complex systems, identifying opportunities, proposing innovative designs, and implementing them in our systems. This is an opportunity to be part of a team that impacts Azure Data’s future offerings, while leveraging and contributing to open-source and internal software. As a research engineer, you have and will further develop a unique mix of experience and skills to help design and build GSL technology that goes far beyond a prototype and is production ready. To build production-quality solutions, you will engage deeply with product teams, but long-term product ownership and ops are not part of GSL charter. There is also the opportunity for you to be part of academic publications and public presentations of the research projects you are involved in.<br><br>The following requirements are indicative and applicants with a different and diverse background are welcome to apply.

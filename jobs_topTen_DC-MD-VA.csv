        It takes powerful technology to connect our brands and partners with an audience of 1 billion. Nearly half of Verizon Media employees are building the code and platforms that help us achieve that. Whether you’re looking to write mobile app code, engineer the servers behind our massive ad tech stacks, or develop algorithms to help us process 4 trillion data points a day, what you do here will have a huge impact on our business—and the world. Want in? As Verizon’s media unit, our brands like Yahoo, TechCrunch and more help people stay informed and entertained, communicate and transact, while creating new ways for advertisers and partners to connect. With technologies like XR, AI, machine-learning, and 5G, we’re transforming media for tomorrow, too. We're creators and coders, dreamers and doers creating what's next in content, advertising and technology.<br><br><strong><u>About Our Team<br><br></u></strong>The Verizon Media DSP (demand side platform) is a core source of revenue for Verizon Media’s ad business, and is the tool that advertisers (and representatives for advertisers) use to create and target campaigns to certain demographics and websites. We then help traffic those campaigns based on what the advertiser specifies and what websites request advertisements to monetize their content, and report on campaign performance back to the user. We are competing in market with players like Google (DBM) and Facebook. We have an aggressive roadmap and are planning to release many innovative features which would require more API developers.<br><br>The team values collaboration, communication, passion, and transparency. We work to allow engineers of any level to make deep, meaningful impact to the product, as well as the business. Our contributions directly impact Verizon Media's bottom line -- we enable the monetization of publisher content across the web and mobile, and facilitate brand awareness and exposure. Our technology scales to over 6 billion requests on a daily basis, runs real-time auctions in milliseconds, and serves millions of ads a day.<br><br><strong><u>What We’re Looking For<br><br></u></strong>Our team is responsible for the API, meaning that most of our work sits in the mid-tier, but we encourage engineers to work across the stack as their interests may lead. If you have a passion for developing scalable, distributed software systems that require high availability to support mission-critical business tasks, we’d love to talk to you!<br><br><u><strong>You are an ideal candidate for our team if you value:<br></strong></u><ul><li>Collaboration and consensus-building as patterns for problem-solving</li><li>Transparency in the face of ambiguous or difficult situations</li><li>“Getting stuff done” through simple, pragmatic iteration and an unwavering focus on product needs</li><li>Demonstrating a high level of curiosity and keeping abreast of the latest technologies</li><li>Taking a proactive nature to resolve problems</li><li>Challenging the status quo, when it makes sense to do so<br></li></ul><strong><u>In a Typical Day, You May Find Yourself<br></u></strong><ul><li>Designing and developing back-end services that are validated by strong unit tests, continuous integration testing, and regression tests.</li><li>Collaborating with peers and leads both within the team and across the organization.</li><li>Working with scrum teams and product managers using agile methodologies to deliver high quality solutions on time.</li><li>Iterating quickly to build features and systems designed to compete with a growing market of competitive ad technology companies.</li><li>Contributing new concepts, techniques, designs and implementations that allow us to offer new and unique features to our clients.</li><li>Mentoring other developers, and working with more senior developers to grow your skill-set.</li><li>Working with the operations team to collect and analyze system performance and metrics and tune application performance to meet aggressive SLAs.<br></li></ul><strong>Requirements<br><br></strong>include the typical problem-solving and algorithmic experience that one expects in any software engineering role, as well as experience in Java; experience in Javascript, C, Hadoop, Druid, and other big data technologies nice-to-have but not required. We do not have degree or time-in-role requirements; rather, we are looking for people who are able to quickly onboard with a supportive engineering team and will be highly motivated to help us execute against aggressive (but not unreasonable) deadlines.<br><br>Verizon Media is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

Software Engineer,Washington DC-Baltimore Area,"
        <p>Nava is at the forefront of reimagining how our government serves its people, and we’re looking for experienced developers to help drive this mission forward.</p><p><br></p><p>You will work on a small, cross-functional team to build scalable digital services for our government – designing, implementing, and delivering software that is depended on by millions of Americans. You care deeply about working on technology that affects people’s lives, and are passionate about building large-scale systems that are well-designed, fast, scalable, and secure.</p><p><br></p><p>Below are some of the traits of candidates who will likely be successful in this role.&nbsp;If you're excited about this opportunity but don't think you meet all the requirements, apply anyway!</p><p><br></p><p>You can work remotely or from Nava’s offices in DC, SF, or NYC. For fully remote roles, view them here. Occasional travel to government partner offices or Nava offices in SF, DC, or NY may be required on a project to project basis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Opportunities and Challenges</strong></p><p>You will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working, sometimes closely, with other government contractors and civil servants. Working with people outside of your company means you'll likely encounter different working styles and cultural norms. At the same time, working as part of a larger team allows us to deliver on projects of larger scale and complexity.</p><p><br></p><p>The government also imposes a level of bureaucracy that is typically not present in a company of our size in the private sector. We operate in a regulated environment, where checks and compliance is built into the process of building software. This can make the path to production slower and some decisions, such as tools and processes, lie outside of our control. However, beyond writing code, finding and recommending ways to improve the way government software is built is one of the highest-leverage ways we help fulfill our mission.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be working with legacy systems. While our work is to build new systems with up-to-date technology, we have to do that within an existing ecosystem. Our work is building functional, resilient software for production. We don't build flashy prototypes that don't work for real people. This usually means getting to know legacy systems, often with poor documentation and unreliable narrators, and trying to determine how to replicate the systems' behavior or how to integrate with these systems. This is a great opportunity for engineers who enjoy software archaeology. If you care deeply about how software systems work over time, and building systems for longevity and resilience, this work is for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What You'll Do...</strong></p><ul><li>Work with fellow Nava engineers to design, review, and build well-crafted software</li><li>Collaborate with government partners and other contractors to architect, implement, and deploy new systems and improvements to existing systems</li><li>Work in an agile manner to efficiently ship new features that meet user needs</li><li>Create tools and processes to automate our development, testing, and production workflows</li><li>Maintain production systems and investigate issues when they occur</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What We're Looking for...</strong></p><ul><li>Meaningful experience working on web-based systems, both frontend and backend</li><li>Experience working on large-scale applications and systems</li><li>An adaptive, empathetic, collaborative and positive mindset</li><li>Ability to think holistically around engineering issues</li><li>Knowledge of engineering fundamentals and architecture</li><li>Expertise developing well-crafted software</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, technical and otherwise</li><li>Experience with modern web development frameworks</li><li>Experience designing and implementing application architectures and code that is highly scalable, available, and performant</li><li>Self-directed, requiring minimal supervision</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Other Requirements...</strong></p><ul><li>Experience: Minimum of 4 years</li><li>Residency: Lived in United States at least 3 years out of the last 5 years</li><li>You will be required to obtain a public trust clearance.</li><li>Travel: Occasional travel to government partner offices or Nava offices in SF, DC, or NY may be required on a project to project basis.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Remote states Nava is actively hiring in: California, DC, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington.</strong></p><p><strong>** If you are not living in or willing to relocate to one of the states listed above, unfortunately, you will not be considered for a position at this time.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We're a small team working to radically improve our government, so everyone that joins us has a direct impact on the direction and success of Nava. We are stewards – we hold a deep responsibility towards the systems that we work with. We are a community – we value collaboration both within our teams and with the many hardworking people within government. We offer generous benefits and equity.</p><p><br></p><p>We care deeply about diversity and inclusion at Nava. We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: We participate in E-Verify.

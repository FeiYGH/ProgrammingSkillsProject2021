        It takes powerful technology to connect our brands and partners with an audience of 1 billion. Nearly half of Verizon Media employees are building the code and platforms that help us achieve that. Whether you’re looking to write mobile app code, engineer the servers behind our massive ad tech stacks, or develop algorithms to help us process 4 trillion data points a day, what you do here will have a huge impact on our business—and the world. Want in? As Verizon’s media unit, our brands like Yahoo, TechCrunch and more help people stay informed and entertained, communicate and transact, while creating new ways for advertisers and partners to connect. With technologies like XR, AI, machine-learning, and 5G, we’re transforming media for tomorrow, too. We're creators and coders, dreamers and doers creating what's next in content, advertising and technology.<br><br><strong><u>About Our Team<br><br></u></strong>The Verizon Media DSP (demand side platform) is a core source of revenue for Verizon Media’s ad business, and is the tool that advertisers (and representatives for advertisers) use to create and target campaigns to certain demographics and websites. We then help traffic those campaigns based on what the advertiser specifies and what websites request advertisements to monetize their content, and report on campaign performance back to the user. We are competing in market with players like Google (DBM) and Facebook. We have an aggressive roadmap and are planning to release many innovative features which would require more API developers.<br><br>The team values collaboration, communication, passion, and transparency. We work to allow engineers of any level to make deep, meaningful impact to the product, as well as the business. Our contributions directly impact Verizon Media's bottom line -- we enable the monetization of publisher content across the web and mobile, and facilitate brand awareness and exposure. Our technology scales to over 6 billion requests on a daily basis, runs real-time auctions in milliseconds, and serves millions of ads a day.<br><br><strong><u>What We’re Looking For<br><br></u></strong>Our team is responsible for the API, meaning that most of our work sits in the mid-tier, but we encourage engineers to work across the stack as their interests may lead. If you have a passion for developing scalable, distributed software systems that require high availability to support mission-critical business tasks, we’d love to talk to you!<br><br><u><strong>You are an ideal candidate for our team if you value:<br></strong></u><ul><li>Collaboration and consensus-building as patterns for problem-solving</li><li>Transparency in the face of ambiguous or difficult situations</li><li>“Getting stuff done” through simple, pragmatic iteration and an unwavering focus on product needs</li><li>Demonstrating a high level of curiosity and keeping abreast of the latest technologies</li><li>Taking a proactive nature to resolve problems</li><li>Challenging the status quo, when it makes sense to do so<br></li></ul><strong><u>In a Typical Day, You May Find Yourself<br></u></strong><ul><li>Designing and developing back-end services that are validated by strong unit tests, continuous integration testing, and regression tests.</li><li>Collaborating with peers and leads both within the team and across the organization.</li><li>Working with scrum teams and product managers using agile methodologies to deliver high quality solutions on time.</li><li>Iterating quickly to build features and systems designed to compete with a growing market of competitive ad technology companies.</li><li>Contributing new concepts, techniques, designs and implementations that allow us to offer new and unique features to our clients.</li><li>Mentoring other developers, and working with more senior developers to grow your skill-set.</li><li>Working with the operations team to collect and analyze system performance and metrics and tune application performance to meet aggressive SLAs.<br></li></ul><strong>Requirements<br><br></strong>include the typical problem-solving and algorithmic experience that one expects in any software engineering role, as well as experience in Java; experience in Javascript, C, Hadoop, Druid, and other big data technologies nice-to-have but not required. We do not have degree or time-in-role requirements; rather, we are looking for people who are able to quickly onboard with a supportive engineering team and will be highly motivated to help us execute against aggressive (but not unreasonable) deadlines.<br><br>Verizon Media is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to, and will not be discriminated against based on age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, disability or any other protected category. Verizon Media is dedicated to providing an accessible environment for all candidates during the application process and for employees during their employment.
